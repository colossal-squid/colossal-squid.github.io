  <h2>About me</h2>
<p>My name is Roman and I always had big interest for programming ever since school. Baby-Roman (me) did his first small programs and games in Adobe Flash MX and Delphi 6. My first websites were static HTML pages for pre-web 2.0 dumb phone browsers, so my school friends could download MIDI ringtones and java games they wanted, those were the days.</p>
<p>For the last <strong>10 years</strong> I've developed backend and middleware in <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Node</strong>, lots of frontend in <strong>angularjs</strong>, <strong>angular</strong> and recently <strong>Vue</strong>. I know my way around styling things with <strong>CSS</strong>, I can render things into canvas using <strong>Pixi</strong> and <strong>three.js</strong>. I did have pleasure writing my own <strong>SQL</strong> queries as well as calling somebody else's PLSQL stored procedures and it was all fun.</p>
<p>All the <strong>NPM</strong> quircks, secret <strong>Git</strong> lifehacks, knowing some <strong>Unix</strong> bits, <strong>Docker</strong> - if you're using these tools too (because who doesnt?) - I am your guy.</p>
<h2>Code samples to check out</h2>
<p><em>this section is work in progress. I have a vast archive of pet-projects in my bitbucket, i'll try to slowly migrate the more interesting ones here, or at least reference them shortly</em></p>

<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/colossal-squid/vue-example-stonks-app">a demo app</a> about monitoring stocks I did in <strong>Vue</strong> recently.</p>
<p>There's some state-management, some web-socket code, responsive layout that doesnt break on mobile and some unit-tests sprinkled in.</p>
<p>You can check it <a href="https://colossal-squid.github.io/vue-example-stonks-app/">live on GH pages too</a></p>
<h2>Commercial products I have worked on recently</h2>

I've developed a browser game about playing piano called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771240/">Piano Rocker</a> as my little free-time side project.
