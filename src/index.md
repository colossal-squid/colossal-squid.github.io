## About me

My name is Roman and I always had big interest for programming ever since school. Baby-Roman (me) did his first small programs and games in Adobe Flash MX and Delphi 6. My first websites were static HTML pages for pre-web 2.0 dumb phone browsers, so my school friends could download MIDI ringtones and java games they wanted, those were the days.

For the last **10 years** I've developed backend and middleware in **Java** and **Node**, lots of frontend in **angularjs**, **angular** and recently **Vue**. I know my way around styling things with **CSS**, I can render things into canvas using **Pixi** and **three.js**. I did have pleasure writing my own **SQL** queries as well as calling somebody else's PLSQL stored procedures and it was all fun.

All the **NPM** quircks, secret **Git** lifehacks, knowing some **Unix** bits, **Docker** - if you're using these tools too (because who doesnt?) - I am your guy.

## Code samples to check out

_this section is work in progress. I have a vast archive of pet-projects in my bitbucket, i'll try to slowly migrate the more interesting ones here, or at least reference them shortly_

Here's [a demo app](https://github.com/colossal-squid/vue-example-stonks-app) about monitoring stocks I did in **Vue** recently. 

There's some state-management, some web-socket code, responsive layout that doesnt break on mobile and some unit-tests sprinkled in.

You can check it [live on GH pages too](https://colossal-squid.github.io/vue-example-stonks-app/)

## Commercial products I have worked on recently

Click around if you're curious. Of course it was a collaboration of an entire team, but my name is still somewhere on git blame in certain places, I'm sure ;) 

- [Mercedes-Benz online store](https://www.mercedes-benz.de/passengercars/buy/new-car.html)
- [Mercedes-Benz car configurator](https://www.mercedes-benz.de/passengercars/configurator.html?group=all&subgroup=see-all&view=BODYTYPE)
- [VMWare vsphere client "storage domain" wizards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30YrY3gqm_k&ab_channel=DellEMC) (this is a video-tutorial about using stuff I had my hands on)

## Piano Rocker

I've developed a browser game about playing piano called [Piano Rocker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771240/) as my little free-time side project. If you're curious, here's a link to [playable demo](https://piano-rocker.roman-guivan.online/) (a MIDI keyboard is recommended but not required).

## Blogging

## Also, I've tried doing some unity games

C# has it's similarities with Java, here are a few things i did in Unity few years ago, compiled for web. No visual studio this time, just vsc and some basic highlighting :)
